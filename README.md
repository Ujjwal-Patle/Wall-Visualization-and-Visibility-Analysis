# Wall-Visualization-and-Visibility-Analysis

This repository contains a web application designed to visualize walls based on user input, including their heights, and to calculate the number of visible walls from both the left and right perspectives. The application allows users to input the number of walls and their respective heights, and then generates a graphical representation of the walls. It also performs visibility analysis to determine how many walls are visible from each direction.
